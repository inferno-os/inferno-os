.SH DESCRIPTION
.I File2chan
is a loadable module for
.IR sh (1)
that provides facilities to create a file in the namespace
with properties determined by a shell script.
.B File2chan
creates
.I filename
in the namespace and spawns a new thread to serve the file.
If the creation succeeds and the thread is spawned successfully,
then the environment variable
.B $apid
is set to the process id of the new thread; otherwise an error (non-nil)
status is returned.
.IR Readcmd ,
.IR writecmd
and
.I closecmd
should be
executable
.IR sh (1)
command blocks.
Subsequently, whenever a process reads from
.IR filename ,
.I readcmd
will be invoked; whenever a process writes
to
.IR filename ,
.I writecmd
will be invoked; whenever an open file on
.I filename
is closed, then
.I closecmd
will be invoked, if present.
.PP
When a read or write request arrives,
it is added to a list of currently outstanding
.I tags
maintained by
.IR file2chan .
If the request is not replied to or acknowledged by the time
the invoked command has finished, then a reply
will be made automatically (the default is to accept
all writes and to give an error on all reads).
Each tag is assigned a unique
.I tag id
which is stored in the environment variable
.B $tag
for the duration of the invoked command.
Most commands take an optional
.I tag
argument which should be the
.I tag id
of a currently outstanding request; if omitted,
the value of
.B $tag
will be used.
The following commands are provided to reply to requests
and obtain information about requests:
.TP 10
.B rblock
.B Rblock
marks
.I tag
as a blocking request - no automatic reply will be made when
the currently invoked command has terminated; the
process making the request will block until a reply is made.
.TP
.B fetchwdata
.B Fetchwdata
writes the data associated with
.I tag
(which must be a write request) to its standard output.
It is useful if an uncorrupted version of binary data is
wanted, as it avoids the data being interpreted as a utf-8
string.
.TP
.B putrdata
.B Putrdata
is the converse of
.BR fetchwdata :
it reads data from its standard input and replies to
.I tag
(which must be a read request) with the data read.
Any data in excess of that requested will be lost.
.TP
.B rerror
.B Rerror
replies to
.I tag
with an error code; the remote read
or write request will return an
error, with the description
.IR errmsg .
.TP
.B rread
.B Rread
replies to the read request
.I tag
with the data in
.IR readdata .
If
.I readdata
is longer than the number of bytes requested,
then only the requested number of bytes of
.I readdata
will
be sent. The offset of the read request is ignored.
.TP
.B rreadone
.B Rreadone
is similar to
.B rread
except that it honours the offset of the client's
read request, so the client can use consecutive
reads to retrieve all of
.IR readdata .
.TP
.B rwrite
.B Rwrite
replies to the write request
.IR tag .
If
.I count
is given, then the client's write request will return
that number (it is usually considered an error if the return
from
.I write
(see
.IR sys-read (2))
is not the same as the number of bytes written).
If
.I count
is omitted, all the bytes are assumed to have been written.
.TP
.B ${rget}
.B Rget
retrieves information associated with
.IR tag .
The information it yields depends on its first argument,
which must be one of:
.RS
.TP
.B data
The data associated with write request
.IR tag .
.TP
.B count
The number  of bytes requested by read request
.IR tag .
.TP
.B fid
The client's file identifier associated with
.IR tag .
A unique
.I fid
is associated with all client requests emanating from
the same open file. This is the only
.B rget
request valid with the
.I tag
associated with a close operation.
.TP
.B offset
The file offset associated with the request
.IR tag .
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
The following code creates a very simple
memory-based file called
.BR /tmp/memfile .
.EX
	file2chan /tmp/memfile {rreadone $data} {data = ${rget data}}
.EE
It is, however, very limited, as binary data stored in the file
will be corrupted, and the size of the file is limited to the amount
of data that can be transmitted in a single Styx message (8192 bytes).
.PP
The following code implements a single-threaded logfile
which can support multiple concurrent writers:
.EX
	{file2chan /chan/log {} {fetchwdata}} >> /tmp/logfile
.EE
.PP
The following code makes the command
.B cmd
available to external programs, and defines a shell function
to use it. Note that there's an approximate 8K limit on the size of the argument
list that can be passed in this way.
.EX
	load std
	file2chan /chan/cmdchan {} {cmd ${unquote ${rget data}}}
	fn runcmd {echo -n ${quote $*} > /chan/cmdchan}
