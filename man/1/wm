wm \- window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wm/wm
[
.I command
[
.IR arg ...
]
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wm
is an inferno window manager, providing the control mechanism for
the user to manage to order and position of a dynamic collection
of application windows.
When started, it runs
.IR command ,
(by default
.BR wm/toolbar ,
see
.IR toolbar (1))
By itself,
.I wm
does not provide any means for starting new applications;
that facility must be provided by an auxilliary program,
.B wm/toolbar
being one such example.
.SS Control Inferface
.I Wm
provides a control interface to programs running inside it
through the
.B Wmcontext
adt that can be obtained from via the
.B Draw->Context
that it passes to applications that it starts
(see
.IR draw-context (2)).
Control messages it understands include:
.TP
.B start \fIwhat\fP
Start input on
.IR what .
.I What
can be
.BR ptr 
(pointer events),
.BR kbd
(keyboard events)
and
.BR control
(window manager control events, see below).
.TP
.B key \fIcharval\fP
Simulate a key event.
.I Charval
is the decimal value of the character that has been
pressed. The character will be sent exactly as if it
had been typed on the keyboard. This facility
is used by
.IR keyboard (2).
.TP
.B !reshape \fItag\fP \fIreqid\fP \fIminx miny maxx maxy\fI \fR[\fIhow\fR]
Reshape or create the window named
.IR tag .
.I Reqid
is ignored;
.I minx..maxy
give the desired bounding rectangle of the
new window.
If
.I how
is not given, or is
.BR exact ,
then
.I wm
will attempt to satisfy the request exactly.
Otherwise,
.I how
tells
.I wm
how to determine the rectangle of the resulting image;
it can be one of
.B place
(choose some appropriate position and size on screen),
.B onscreen
(modify the requested rectangle only so as to bring
it on screen), or
.B max
(request the maximum available rectangle).
.TP
.B delete \fItag\fP
Delete the window named by \fItag\fP.
.TP
.B raise
Raise all windows for the current context above the others.
.TP
.B lower
Send all windows for the current context to the bottom.
.TP
.B !move \fItag\fP \fIreqid\fP \fIstartx\fP \fIstarty\fP
Drag window
.I tag
interactively.
.I Reqid
is ignored.
.I Startx
and
.I starty
give the location of the pointer when the drag was initiated.
.TP
.B !size \fItag\fP \fIreqid\fP
Interactively resize window \fItag\fP.
.TP
.B fixedorigin
By default, if a window changes position but not size,
.I wm
changes the origin of the window without creating a new image.
Sending
.B fixedorigin
caused
.I wm
always to create a new image in that case.
.TP
.B kbdfocus \fR[\fIin\fR]
If the decimal integer
.I in
is non-zero, request the keyboard focus,
otherwise lose the keyboard focus.
.PP
.I Wm
generates control messages to inform applications of
things that have happened. These include:
.TP
.B rect \fIminx miny maxx maxy\fP
The screen rectangle has changed.
.I "minx..maxy"
gives the new bounding box of the screen.
.TP
.B haskbdfocus \fIin\fP
Informs an application of its current keyboard focus state.
This message is generated in response to pointer events,
and due to
.B kbdfocus
requests.
.TP
.B exit
The window manager is closing down.
.SS Controlling Application
The first application that starts under
.I wm
is given the privilege of being able to control
other applications running under the same
.IR wm .
If it sends a
.B start control
message, then it will also see any control requests
sent by applications that
.I wm
itself does not understand and information about applications
starting and leaving.
.I Wm
accepts several other control messages from its
controlling application:
.TP
.B ctl \fIid\fP \fImsg\fP
Send message
.I msg
to application
.IR id .
.TP
.B endcontrol
Relinquish controller status.
The next application that starts will get control status.
This is used, for instance, to segue smoothly between
.IR logon (1)
and
.IR toolbar (1).
.PP
If the controlling application has started control messages,
.I wm
sends it the following messages:
.TP
.B newclient \fIid\fP
A new client has connected, identified by
.IR id .
.TP
.B delclient \fIid\fP
Client
.I id
has left.
.TP
.B request \fIid\fP \fImsg\fP
Client
.I id
sent the request
.I msg
to the window manager, which it did not understand.
This facility is used, for instance, by
.IR toolbar (1)
to implement the
.B task
and
.B untask
requests.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /chan/wmrect
File holding current screen rectangle.
