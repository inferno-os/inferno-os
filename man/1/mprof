.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mprof
is a simple memory profiling tool which calculates the amount of main, heap and image memory
used on a 
particular line of limbo source or in a particular limbo function or module. The main memory
in question covers the space taken by dis code, jit code, runtime stacks and dynamic C module text, data and relocation areas. The heap memory covers all other limbo data structures. The source in
question should be compiled with the 
.B -g
flag so that the relevant symbol table files exist. In its simplest form, the memory
profiler shows a line number, the current memory in bytes allocated
when executing this line, the high water memory in bytes allocated when executing
this line and the limbo source. This information is also available at the function and
module level.
.PP
The tk version of the profiler
.I wm/mprof
shows this information in a text widget and colours the lines of source according
to the amount of memory allocated by the line. The darker the colour, the
more memory used.
.PP
The
.B -b
option starts profiling.
.PP
The
.B -c
option clears all profiling statistics and state in the memory profiling device. If any commands are specified to
.B mprof
, this is done automatically. It's specific
use is to end the accumulation of statistics when profiling interactively. See the
example below.
.PP
The
.B -M
option shows the memory statistics for each module
The
.B -f
option shows the memory statistics for each function.
.PP
The
.B -l
option shows the memory statistics for each line. If neither this option nor the
.B -M
and
.B -f
options are given, 
.B -M
and
.B -l
are assumed.
.PP
The
.B -n
option lists the name of the file along with the line number.
.PP
The
.B -v
option outputs all functions and/or lines even when they do not involve memory
allocating or freeing operations.
.PP
The
.B -m
option lists the module names which are to be profiled. If none are given, all the
modules loaded by the kernel will be profiled. The name may be the actual name of
the module or its path name.
.PP
The
.B -e
option profiles the module that is loaded first in any following command. In this case
there is no need to give a
.B -m
option as this is added automatically.
.PP
The
.B -1
option profiles only main memory (pool number 1 in the kernel). The default is
to profile main, heap and image memory.
.PP
The
.B -2
option profiles only heap memory (pool number 2 in the kernel). The default is
to profile main, heap and image memory.
.PP
The
.B -3
option profiles only image memory (pool number 3 in the kernel). The default is
to profile main, heap and image memory.
.PP
Any remaining arguments are assumed to
specify a command and set of arguments to the command. If this is the case,
.B mprof
will automatically start profiling, run the command to completion and then
stop profiling before showing the profile statistics.
.PP
.B Mprof
displays the profile statistics (unless the
.B -b
option is being used) according to the output format required.

.SH EXAMPLE
.EX
To profile a particular command
	mprof /dis/math/parts 10000
	wm/mprof /dis/math/parts 10000
To profile the same command but restrict attention to its own module (Partitions).
	mprof -m Partitions /dis/math/parts 10000
	wm/mprof -m Partitions /dis/math/parts 10000
A shorter version of the above
	mprof -e /dis/math/parts 10000
	wm/mprof -e /dis/math/parts 10000
To profile interactively
	mprof -b -m Polyhedra
	wm/polyhedra &
	mprof -M -f -l -n
	<interact with wm/polyhedra ...>
	mprof -M -f -l -n
	wm/mprof
	mprof -c

Note that the output format options (
.B -M
,
.B -f
, 
.B -l
, 
.B -n
, 
.B -v
) are ignored when 
.B -b
is present.

.SH BUGS
Can take quite a time to present statistics when profiling all modules in the
system.
