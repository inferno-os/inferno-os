.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Import
dials the Plan 9
.I host
(which might be the current host) and makes the given
.I file
on that system visible in the local name space as
.I localfile
(if
.I localfile
is not given,
.I file
is used as the local name).
The authentication agent
.IR factotum (4)
must be active.
(When Inferno is running on Plan 9, Plan 9's own authentication
agent can be used, by binding Plan 9's
.B /mnt/factotum
to the same name in Inferno's own name space. See
.IR fs (3)).
The remote files are accessed with the permissions of the user authenticated
to the remote system by
.IR factotum .
.PP
If the remote
.I file
is a directory, the whole file tree rooted at that
directory is accessible, the local mount point must also be a directory,
and the
.BR -a ,
.BR -b ,
and
.B -c
options control the creation of union directories just as for
.IR bind (1).
By default, the remote file replaces the local one in the name space.
.PP
If the
.B -e
option is given, the network connection can be encrypted, or provided
with digests to authenticate the contents, or both.
.I Crypt
is an encryption algorithm accepted by
.IR ssl (3);
.I hash
is one of its digest algorithms.
Plan 9's
.I exportfs
normally requires
.B
\&'rc4_256 sha1'
on such connections;
it currently provides no negotiation of algorithms.
.PP
The
.B -k
option gives a string of space separated
.IB attr = value
pairs that control
.IR factotum 's
selection of a suitable key for the remote system.
.PP
.I 9export
serves the Plan 9
.I exportfs
protocol on its standard input,
allowing a Plan 9 system to import parts of the Inferno name space in which
.I 9export
is run.
If the
.B -A
option is given, the caller is not authenticated, line encryption and message authentication
are not done,
and the Plan 9
.I exportfs
protocol starts immediately.
Otherwise,
.IR factotum (4)
must be accessible via
.B /mnt/factotum
as for
.IR import ,
and it is used to run the Plan 9 authentication protocol.
The
.B -e
and
.B -k
options are as for
.IR import .
Normally
.I 9export
returns when the client closes the connection; the
.B -a
option causes
.I 9export
to return immediately, leaving a kernel process to serve the name space.
.I 9export
might be used as follows:
.IP
.EX
listen -Av 'tcp!*!exportfs' {9export&}
.EE
.PP
Beware that currently the name space is served with the permissions of the
person running
.IR 9export ,
not those of the caller.
