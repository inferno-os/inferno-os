.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Collabsrv
listens on network address
.I netaddress
(default:
.BR tcp!*!9999 )
for incoming requests to attach to services
it offers.
The services are defined by the contents of directory
.IR dir
(default:
.BR /services/collab ).
.I Collabsrv
serves an authenticated Styx connection that exports the contents of
.IB dir /export
(default:
.BR /services/collab/export ).
The exported name space can contain directories from a shared file server,
but it will also contain a directory
.B services
giving access to any collaborative activity services that have been configured.
.PP
The
.B services
directory contains a single
.B ctl
file and a set of subdirectories, numbered
.BR 0 ,
.BR 1
and so on.
The
.B ctl
is used to activate and access services.
Each service instance is identified by a name;
clients connect to a given instance by presenting its name.
Each directory represents one instance of a service.
Each service instance corresponds to a name space; the clients
all share that name space.
The name space is determined by the service.
.PP
A client wishing to make use of the services must first
.IR sys-dial (2)
to connect to
.IR collabsrv,
and authenticate and mount the resulting Styx connection.
It can do so using the
.I mount
command
(see
.IR bind (1)),
or by
using
.IR security-auth (2)
and
.B Sys->mount
(see
.IR sys-bind (2)).
Normally, this is done by
.IR collab (1).
.PP
A new connection to a particular service is requested by opening the
.B ctl
file for reading and writing,
writing a service request to it, and reading back
the number of the directory corresponding to the requested service.
A service request written to
.B ctl
is text of the following form:
.IP
.DS
.I "service id"
.DE
.PP
where
.I service
is a string specifying the type of service (eg,
.BR chat )
and
.I id
is a string identifying the instance.
The server does not interpret
.IR id ;
it is up to the clients to agree a naming convention (often
using the name of a shared file as an
.IR id ).
.I Collabsrv
will connect to instance
.I id
of the requested
.I service
type
if one is already running, or start one if necessary;
the write request returns an error if the service cannot be started.
Following a successful write to
.BR ctl ,
a read will return the number of the service
directory containing the client's private connection to that service instance.
Closing the
.B ctl
file disconnects from the service.
.PP
Available services are defined by a configuration file
.BR /services/collab/services.cfg ,
which contains a sequence of configuration
entries of the following form:
.IP
.EX
.I service
.br
\f5	path=\fIdisfile\fP
.EE
.PP
where
.I service
is the name presented in a service request, and
.I disfile
names a Dis file implementing that service;
path names are interpreted relative to
.BR /services/collab ,
but usually refer to files in
.BR /dis/collab/servers .
.PP
Each
.I collabsrv
service is represented by a name space peculiar to that service.
The interface to the service is therefore implemented by a service-specific Styx server
.RI ( disfile
in the configuration file).
Current services are described below.
.SS "Chat"
.I Chatsrv
provides a simple service for the exchange of text messages.
It serves a name space containing two files.
The files together represent a single messaging group:
.TF users
.TP
.B users
A read-only file that lists the user names of the current members of the group, one per line.
The version number of the file's Qid
(see
.IR sys-stat (2))
is incremented each time a client arrives or leaves.
.TP
.B msgs
.RS
A client connects to the messaging group by opening this file.
A message is sent to the group by writing to the file.
Each read returns the next unread message, prefixed by the name of the sender,
or
.B <you>
for a message sent by the current client.
A client sees no messages sent before it connects.
Messages are delivered in the same order to all clients; clients receive their own messages.
Two special messages are generated by the server:
.IP
.EX
+++ \fIname\fP has arrived
--- \fIname\fP has left
.EE
.PP
as clients come and go.
.RE
.SS "Multiplexor"
.I Mpx
offers a general fan-out/fan-in multiplexing service for a tree of processes,
with one controlling or root process at the root of the tree,
and a set of client processes at the leaves of the tree.
It serves three files:
.TF users
.TP
.B root
An exclusive-use file read and written by the root process
to communicate with the leaf processes.
.TP
.B leaf
Client processes read and write this file to communicate with the
root process (each
.B open
of
.B leaf
is independent).
It cannot be opened until a process has opened
.BR root .
After
.B root
has been closed, and any remaining messages on
.B leaf
have been read,
subsequent reads will return zero bytes (end-of-file).
.TP
.B users
A read-only text file that lists the user names of processes that currently have
.B leaf
open.
There is one line per leaf, containing a unique numeric ID for the leaf, a space, and then the users's name.
.PP
A message written to
.B root
is replicated on all instances of
.B leaf
that are currently open.
A message written to any instance of
.B leaf
will be read by the process reading
.BR root .
Data written to both
.B root
and
.B leaf
has a prefix added to identify the sender, causing messages
to have the following format:
.IP
.EX
.I "seq clientid op name data"
.EE
.PP
where
.I seq
is a unique message sequence number;
.I clientid
is a unique number identifying the process amongst currently connected clients,
with 0 identifying the root process;
.I op
is a single character giving the message type (see below);
.I name
is the sending process's user name; and
.I data
is the data written by the process, which can be text or binary (the message header is always text).
.I Mpx
also generates messages as root and leaf processes arrive and leave.
These are identified by
.IR op .
The various
.I op
values and the direction in which they can occur are listed below:
.TP
.B a
New leaf process has arrived (leaf to root)
.TP
.B M
Message from root process (root to leaf)
.TP
.B m
Message from leaf process (leaf to root)
.TP
.B L
Root process has left (root to leaf)
.TP
.B l
Leaf process has left (leaf to root)
.PP
Messages are only ever sent from the root to all leaves, or from a leaf to the root,
never from leaf to leaf; the root process could of course rebroadcast a message from a leaf.
The multiplexor service is used to implement
a real-time poll
(see
.B poll
and
.B poller
in
.IR collab-clients (1)),
but could be used for several other services, such as auctions.
.SS "Whiteboard"
.I Wbsrv
offers a service for sharing a simple line drawing.
It serves two files:
.TP
.B wb.bit
A read-only file containing an uncompressed
.IR image (6)
with the current state of the drawing.
.TP
.B strokes
This file is read and written to exchange strokes with other clients.
A stroke has the following representation:
.RS
.IP
.IR "colour width x0 y0 x1 y1 " ...
.PP
where all values are space-separated decimal numbers:
.I colour
is an index into the
.IR rgbv (6)
colour map;
.I width
is the width of the line in pixels, and
the sequence of coordinate pairs defines the connected line segments to draw.
A stroke is transmitted from one client to all others by writing a stroke description to the file in a single write.
Each read returns a description of a stroke made by another client.
.RE
.PP
A whiteboard client should read the
.B wb.bit
file to obtain its image, then read the
.B strokes
file for instructions to keep it up to date.
