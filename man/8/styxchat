.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Styxchat
exchanges messages with a Styx service.
See
.IR intro (5)
for the protocol definition.
It makes a connection to a given
.IR destination ,
(or waits for a connection on
.IR destination,
if the
.B -s
option is specified),
then reads a textual representation of Styx T-messages from the standard
input and writes them on the connection, with a copy on standard output,
simultaneously reading Styx R-messages from the connection and printing a representation of them
on standard output.
Each message is represented by one line
on the standard output in the form of a literal of either
.B Tmsg
or
.B Rmsg
types defined in
.IR styx (2).
The
.B -v
option causes a second line to be written for
.B Rmsg.Read
and
.B Tmsg.Write
that shows the data transmitted, as text or binary as appropriate;
if
.B -v
appears a second time, a third line is written that
shows the text equivalent of apparently binary data (useful to see text that is surrounded by binary data).
.PP
By default,
.I destination
is the name of a file, typically one end of a named pipe.
The
.B \-n
option causes
.I destination
to be interpreted as a network address, as accepted by
.IR sys-dial (2)
(or
.I listen
with
.BR -s ).
If
.I destination
is not provided,
.B styxchat
reads and writes Styx messages on its standard input,
using
.B /dev/cons
where it would usually use its standard input and output.
.PP
Each line of standard input has the form:
.IP
.br
.BI  Tversion " messagesize version"
.br
.BI Tauth " afid uname aname"
.br
.BI Tflush " oldtag"
.br
.BI Tattach " fid afid uname aname"
.br
.BI Twalk " fid newfid \f1[\fP name \f1... ]\fP"
.br
.BI Topen " fid mode"
.br
.BI Tcreate " fid name perm mode"
.br
.BI Tread " fid offset count"
.br
.BI Twrite " fid offset data"
.br
.BI Tclunk " fid"
.br
.BI Tremove " fid"
.br
.BI Tstat " fid"
.br
.BI Twstat " fid name uid gid mode mtime length"
.br
.BI nexttag " \f1[\fP tag \f1]\fP"
.br
.B dump
.PD
.PP
The input is interpreted as space-separated fields
using the quoting conventions of
.IR sh (1),
allowing fields to contain spaces.
Empty lines and lines beginning with
.B #
are ignored.
The first field on each line is normally the name of a T-message.
Subsequent fields provide parameter values for
the corresponding message.
Integers are given in the format accepted for integers
by the Limbo compiler (e.g.
.BR 16rffff ):
a
.I tag
is 16 bits,
.I offset
and
.I length
are 64 bits, and all others are 32-bit integers.
If the an integer parameter field contains
.BR ~0 ,
it is taken to be the `all ones' value of appropriate size for that parameter;
this is particularly useful with
.BR Twstat ,
where that value represents `no change'.
In the ``mode'' field of a qid, letters can be given, representing
mode bits:
.B d
for
.BR QTDIR ,
.B l
for
.BR QTEXCL ,
.B a
for
.BR QTAPPEND ,
and
.B u
for
.BR QTAUTH .
In an
.B Rstat
message, the qid mode bits are copied into the
.B Rstat
mode field in the appropriate place.
.PP
Following the
.IR sh (1)
quoting rules,
an empty string is represented by a field containing \f5''\f1.
The
.I data
field is sent as its UTF-8 representation as an array of bytes.
The value for
.I fid
can be
.B nofid
(or
.BR NOFID )
to represent the `no fid' value in the protocol.
The
.I tag
for each message is automatically supplied by
.IR styxchat ,
starting from 1, and incremented with each successful message transmission.
The
.B nexttag
command will cause subsequent tags to start from
.IR tag ;
if none is given, it will print the next tag value.
The
.I tag
may be
.B notag
to represent the `no tag' value
.RB ( 16rFFFF ).
.PP
The
.B dump
command has the same effect as a
.B -v
option, allowing data display to be enabled later.
.PP
By default,
.I styxchat
sends a Styx client's T-messages and prints a server's R-messages.
The
.B -s
option causes it to present a server's view: it prints the T-messages from Styx clients, and sends R-messages
as it reads a textual representation of them from standard input:
.IP
.br
.BI Rversion " tag messagesize version"
.br
.BI Rauth " tag aqid"
.br
.BI Rflush " tag"
.br
.BI Rerror " tag ename"
.br
.BI Rattach " tag qid"
.br
.BI Rwalk " tag qid ..."
.br
.BI Ropen " tag qid iounit"
.br
.BI Rcreate " tag qid iounit"
.br
.BI Rread " tag data"
.br
.BI Rwrite " tag count"
.br
.BI Rclunk " tag"
.br
.BI Rremove " tag"
.br
.BI Rstat " tag qid mode atime mtime length name uid gid muid"
.br
.BI Rwstat " tag"
.br
.B dump
.PD
.PP
The input conventions are as above, except that tags
are required.
A
.I qid
is a single field of the form \fIpath\f1\f5.\f1\fIvers\f1[\f5.\f1\fItype\f1],
where the three values are decimal integers.
