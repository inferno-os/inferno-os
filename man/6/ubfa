.SH NAME
ubfa \- universal binary format for data transport
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I UBF(A)
is the data transport encoding for Armstrong's
Universal Binary Format.
It provides four primitive types: atoms (symbolic constants), integers, strings, and binary data.
There are two compound types: fixed-length tuples and variable-length lists.
.IR Ubfa (2)
provides basic support in Limbo for reading and writing streams of UBF(A)-encoded data.

The
.I input
syntax is defined by the following rules:

.EX
.ft R
.ta \w'\f2simple-xxx\f1'u +\w'\ ::=\ 'u
\f2input\fP	::=	\f2item\fP* '$'

White space is any sequence of blank, tab, newline or carriage-return characters, and can appear
before or after any instance of
.I item
in the grammar.
.PP
The
.I input
data is interpreted by a simple virtual machine.
The machine contains a stack of values of primitive and compound types, and a set of registers also containing
values of those types.
White space and comments are ignored.
Primitive
.IR integer ,
.I atom
and
.IR string
values are pushed onto the stack as they are recognised.
Certain input bytes outside any value act as operators:
.TP
.B {
Note the current stack depth.
.TP
.B }
Pop stack values to restore the most recently noted stack depth.
Push a single value
representing a tuple of those items; the left-most value in the tuple is the last one popped
(the first in the original input stream).
.TP
.B ~
Pop an integer value
.I n
from the stack.
Read
.I n
bytes from the input stream and push a value onto the stack that represents them.
The next byte must be the character
.BR ~ ,
which is discarded.
.TP
.B #
Push a value representing an empty list onto the stack.
.TP
.B &
Pop a value
.IR v .
Pop another value
.IR l ,
which must represent a list.
Push a value that represents
the list
.IB v :: l .
(Note that the items in a
.I list
therefore appear in reverse order in the input stream.)
.TP
.BI > reg
Pop the top value from the stack and store it in a register labelled by the byte
.IR reg .
.TP
.I reg
Push the value of register
.I reg
(which must be non-null) onto the stack.
.TP
.I tag
Associate the tag string with the value on top of the stack.
The
.IR ubfa (2)
implementation does so by replacing it by a special
.B Tag
tuple.
.TP
.B $
End-of-input: there must be exactly one value on the stack,
which is the result.
.PP
Applications using UBF(A) typically take turns to exchange
.I input
values on a communication channel.
