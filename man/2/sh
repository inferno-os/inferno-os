.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sh
is a command-line interpreter and a scripting language;
it also presents a module interface to allow Limbo
modules to access its functionality at a lower level.
The
.B Sh
module can be used in several different ways.
At the simplest level, it can be run as a command-line
program; for details of this, see
.IR sh (1).
The simplest access at the Limbo level is through
the
.B system
function, which given a
.I draw
.B Context
(see
.IR draw-context (2))
and a string
executes the
.I sh
command contained in
.I s
and returns its result. It catches any exceptions raised by the command.
Almost as simple is
.BR exec ,
which runs
.I argv
as a command, taking the first word as the command to be
executed (it can be a braced block) and giving the rest as arguments,
catching any exceptions raised.
.PP
Although program arguments are passed to external programs
as lists of strings, at the
.B Sh
module level, an argument list is held as a
.BR "list of ref Listnode" .
A
.B Listnode
holds either a simple string, or a braced block
that has been parsed by the shell. Sometimes it can hold
both; in this case the string and the block both represent
the same thing.
.B Parse
converts from a string to a
.B Cmd
(a braced block). It returns a tuple
.RI ( cmd ,\  error )
where
.I cmd
holds the parsed block,
and
.I error
is non-empty if an error has occurred doing so.
.B Cmd2string
performs the opposite conversion; it returns
a string that when parsed will yield the same command
block it was passed.
The utility functions
.B List2stringlist
and
.B stringlist2list
convert from and to a
.B list of ref Listnode
to or from a
.B list of string
respectively.
.PP
A
.B Context
holds all the state information needed by a currently running
.I sh
process; this adt holds current values of environment variables
and a list of currently loaded modules and builtin commands.
It is specific to the process within which it was created.
If it is desired to run
.I sh
commands in a newly spawned process, a new
.B Context
must be created, or a copy of an existing Context made (making
sure to synchronise access until the copy has been made).
.TP 10
.BI Context.new( drawcontext )
.B New
creates a new context.
.I Drawcontext
represents the current graphics context
within which
.I sh
commands will be run
(see
.IR draw-context (2)).
.TP
.IB ctxt .get(\fPname\fP)
.B Get
retrieves the value of environment variable
.I name
from
.IR ctxt .
It is retrieved from the innermost scope in which
a value for
.I name
has been set.
.TP
.IB ctxt .set(\fPname\fP,\ \fPvalue\fP)
.B Set
sets the value of environment variable
.I name
in
.IR ctxt
to
.IR value .
It is set in the innermost scope in which a value
for
.I name
has been set, or the outermost level if it has
not been set.
.TP
.IB ctxt .setlocal(\fPname\fP,\ \fPvalue\fP)
Similar to
.B set()
except that the value is set in the innermost scope
that has been pushed.
.TP
.IB ctxt .envlist()
.B Envlist
retrieves the list of all the environment variables
currently in scope, and their values.
It returns a list of
.RI ( name ,\  value )
tuples, where
.I name
is the name of the variable and
.I value
is its value.
.TP
.IB ctxt .push()
.B Push
creates a new innermost environment variable scope.
.TP
.IB ctxt .pop()
.B Pop
discards the current innermost scope, losing the
values of all variables that have been defined there.
It is an error to
.B pop
a context that has not been pushed.
Care must be taken to ensure that a
.B push
is always matched by a
.BR pop.
In particular, exceptions should be caught,
the context popped, and the exception re-raised.
.TP
.IB ctxt .copy(\fPcopyenv\fP)
The shell's
.B Context
is associated with a particular process;
.B copy
returns a copy of
.I ctxt
associated with the current process. If
.I copyenv
is non-zero, the whole environment will be copied - this
should be set if the new process is to run asynchronously - i.e.
if there is a chance that there might be two processes accessing the
context in parallel. It is an error to copy a context if not
within a new process.
.TP
.IB ctxt .run(\fPargs\fP,\ \fPlast\fP)
.B Run
executes a
.I sh
command.
.I Last
should be non-zero if this is the last time
that
.B run
will be called, so
.I sh
does not have to spawn a new process in order
to hide file redirection side-effects.
.TP
.IB ctxt .addmodule(\fPname\fP,\ \fPmod\fP)
.B Addmodule
adds the
.B Shellbuiltin
module
.I mod
to its list of builtin modules.
The module will be initialised as described in
``Builtin modules'', below.
.TP
.IB ctxt .addbuiltin(\fPname\fP,\ \fPmod\fP)
.B Addbuiltin
may be called by a module that has previously
been loaded by
.B addmodule
or by the
.B load
.I sh
command to add a new builtin command
to the shell. Any subsequent invocation of
.I name
within
.I ctxt
will result in a call of
.B runbuiltin()
to
.IR mod .
Any attempt to redefine the command
.RB `` builtin ''
will be ignored.
.TP
.IB ctxt .removebuiltin(\fPname\fP,\ \fPmod\fP)
.B Removebuiltin
removes
.I name
from the list of builtin commands in
.IR ctxt .
If
.I name
had not previously been defined by
.IR mod ,
or had subsequently been replaced, then
this function does nothing.
.TP
.IB ctxt .addsbuiltin(\fPname\fP,\ \fPmod\fP)
.B Addsbuiltin
may be called by a module that has previously
been loaded by
.B addmodule
or by the
.B load
.I sh
command to add a new builtin substitution operator
to the shell.
Any subsequent invocation of
.BI ${ name }
within
.I ctxt
will result in a call of
.B runsbuiltin()
to
.IR mod .
.TP
.IB ctxt .removesbuiltin(\fPname\fP,\ \fPmod\fP)
.B Removesbuiltin
removes
.I name
from the list of builtin substitution operators in
.IR ctxt .
If
.I name
had not previously been defined by
.IR mod ,
or had subsequently been replaced, then
this function does nothing.
.TP
.IB ctxt .fail(\fPename\fP,\ \fPmsg\fP)
.B Fail
prints
.I msg
to the standard error if message printing
is currently enabled, and raises
the exception
.BI fail: ename\f1.\fP
.TP
.IB ctxt .options()
.B Options
returns a bitmask of the options currently enabled in
.IR ctxt .
The bits are defined by constants declared within
.BR Context .
They include:
.RS
.TP
.IB ctxt .INTERACTIVE
.I Sh
is currently being run from an interactive command-line.
.TP
.IB ctxt .VERBOSE
Message printing is currently enabled.
.TP
.IB ctxt .EXECPRINT
Commands are printed to standard error
as they are executed.
.TP
.IB ctxt .ERROREXIT
An exception will be raised when the first
simple command returns an error status.
.PP
Options are defined in the innermost scope
of
.I ctxt
and will be lost when it is
.BR pop ped.
.RE
.TP
.IB ctxt .setoptions(\fPflags\fP,\ \fPon\fP)
.B Setoptions
sets the specified
.I flags
within
.IR ctxt .
.I Flags
is a bitmask of options, as described in
.BR options ,
above. If
.I on
is non-zero, the specified bits will be set;
otherwise they will be reset.
.B Setoptions
returns the previously set options bitmask.
.SS Builtin modules
.B Shellbuiltin
specifies the interface to a loadable
.I sh
builtin module. Any Limbo module
.I mod
adhering to this
interface may be loaded into the shell.
.TP 10
.IB mod ->initbuiltin(\fPctxt\fP,\ \fPsh\fP)
.B Initbuiltin
is called when
.I sh
loads
.I mod
either via the
.B load
command, or via the
.B loadmodule()
function.
.I Ctxt
is the context within which the builtin has been
loaded, and
.I sh
is the
.B Sh
module itself. When
.B initbuiltin
is called,
.I mod
is expected to call
.IB ctxt .addbuiltin
and
.IB ctxt .addsbuiltin
to define any builtin commands and builtin substitution
operators that it wants. If an error occurs on
initialisation,
.B initbuiltin
should return a non-nil value; this will cause the load to fail.
.TP
.IB mod ->runbuiltin(\fPctxt\fP,\ \fPsh\fP,\ \fPcmd\fP,\ \fPlast\fP)
.B Runbuiltin
is invoked when
.I sh
executes a command that has previously been
defined as a builtin command by
.IR mod .
.I Ctxt
is the current execution context (which may not be
the original context passed to
.BR initbuiltin() ),
.I sh
is the running
.B Sh
module, and
.I cmd
is the command to be executed.
.I Last
is true if this is the last command to be executed
in the current process; it can be passed to
.IB ctxt .run()
as appropriate.
The name of the command can be found in
.BR "(hd cmd).word" .
.B Runbuiltin
returns its exit status; by convention this
is the exit status of the last command executed.
A non-nil exit status is usually treated as false.
By convention, if an invalid set of arguments are
passed to a builtin command, a
.B usage
exception is raised by calling 
.IB ctxt .fail
with
.B "usage"
and an explanatory usage message as arguments.
.TP
.IB mod ->runsbuiltin(\fPctxt\fP,\ \fPsh\fP,\ \fPcmd\fP)
Similar to
.BR runbuiltin ,
.B runsbuiltin
is called when
.I sh
encounters a builtin substitution operator
that has previously been defined by
.IR mod .
It returns the list of values that will be
substituted in place of the operator.
.TP
.IB mod ->getself()
.B Getself
should return the
.B Shellbuiltin
module handle for
.IR mod ,
usually obtained by invoking
.BR "load $self" .
N.B. it is important that the value returned
by
.B getself
is the same as that passed to
.B addbuiltin
or
.BR addsbuiltin .
As the Limbo
.B load
operator returns a different value each time,
the value to be returned by
.B getself()
should be initialised once,
during the call to 
.BR initbuiltin() .
.TP 10
.IB mod ->whatis(\fPctxt\fP,\ \fPsh\fP,\ \fPname\fP,\ \fPwtype\fP)
.B Whatis
is called by the shell's
.B whatis
command to query the definition of a name.
.I Wtype
gives the type of name that is being asked about; it can be
.B BUILTIN
(conventional commands),
.BR SBUILTIN
(substitution builtins),
or
.BR OTHER
(any other names that the module defines).
Return
.B nil
to get the usual default behaviour. The
.B std
module, for example, uses this feature to
display the definition of a shell function
correctly.
.SS Exceptions
The exceptions used within
.I sh
are exactly the same as those used within Limbo,
except that all exceptions generated by the
shell are prefixed by the string
.RB `` fail: '',
and any exception caught with the prefix
.B fail:
has its first 5 characters removed before
being made available to the
.I sh
script.
This adheres to the convention defined by
other shells within Inferno that a process
that raises an exception with a
.B fail:
prefix is just returning a non-zero exit status,
and should not be left in a Broken state.
It also means that the number of bytes available
for the exception string is reduced by 5
(to 59). Care must therefore be taken to avoid
generating an exception with a name that is too long;
.I sh
takes the pragmatic approach of truncating any
exception string that is too long.
.SH FILES
.TP 10
.BI /prog/ pid /wait
The file used by the shell to wait for dead child processes.
