.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines perform time conversions relative to the
epoch 00:00:00 GMT, Jan. 1, 1970.
Note the range of values for each member of the
.B Tm
adt.
The conventions are the same as those of C's
.IR ctime .
.PP
.B Text
converts a time structure referenced by
.I tm
from local or GMT time to a string in the format:
.IP
.B "Sat Jan  1 13:00:00 GMT 2000"
.PP
.B Filet
converts the file access or modification time
.I t
from seconds since the epoch to local time as a string
in the format:
.IP
.B "Jan  1 13:00"
.PP
if the file is less than 6 months old or
.IP
.B "Jan  1 2000"
.PP
if the file is older than 6 months, compared to the time
.IR now .
.PP
.B Gmt
converts seconds since the epoch, received in
.IR tim ,
to a time structure in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
.PP
.B Local
converts seconds since the epoch, received in
.IR tim ,
to a time structure in local time.
.PP
.B Now
returns the time in seconds since the epoch, obtained by reading
.B /dev/time
(see
.IR cons (3)).
.PP
.B Time
converts seconds since the epoch
to the local time as a string in the format
.BR "Fri May 19 17:01:36 BST 2000" .
.PP
.B Tm2epoch
converts a time structure referenced by
.I tm
from local or GMT time to seconds since the epoch.
.PP
.B String2tm
returns a reference to a
.B Tm
value corresponding to the date and time in textual form in string
.IR s ,
which must have one of the forms below:
.IP
.EX
Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT    \fR(RFC822, RFC1123)\fP
Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT   \fR(RFC850)\fP
Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 GMT 1994     \fR(output of \fPtext\fR, above)\fP
.EE
.PP
A missing time zone in any format is assumed to be
.BR GMT .
.B String2tm
returns nil if
.I s
is not correctly formed.

epoch.
