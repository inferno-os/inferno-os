.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B Tk
module provides primitives for building user interfaces, based on
Ousterhout's Tcl/TK.
The interface to the toolkit itself is primarily the passing of strings
to and from the elements of the toolkit using the
.B cmd
function; see section 9 of this manual for more information
about the syntax of those strings.
.IR Tkclient (2)
is conventionally used to create tk windows
that interact correctly with a running window manager.
.PP
.B Toplevel
creates a new window
called a
.BR Toplevel ,
which is under the control of the
.B Tk
toolkit,
on an existing
.IR display ,
usually one inherited from the graphics
.B Context
(see
.IR draw-context (2)).
The
.B Toplevel
is passed to
.B cmd
and
.B namechan
.RI ( q.v. )
to drive the widgets in the window.
.I Arg
is a string containing creation options (such as
.BR "-borderwidth 2" )
that are applied when creating the toplevel window.
.PP
.B Cmd
passes command strings to the widgets in the
.B Toplevel
.I t
and returns the string resulting from their execution.
For example, given a canvas
.B .c
in the
.B Toplevel
.BR t ,
.EX
    x := int tk->cmd(t, ".c cget -actx");
.EE
returns the integer
.I x
coordinate of the canvas.
.PP
Bindings can be created in a
.B Toplevel
that trigger strings to be sent on Limbo channels.
Such channels must be declared to the
.B Tk
module using
.BR namechan .
For example, to create a button that sends the word
.B Ouch
when it is pressed:
.EX
    hitchannel := chan of string;
    tk->namechan(t, hitchannel, "channel");
    tk->cmd(t,
         "button .b.Hit -text Hit -command {send channel Ouch}");
    expl := <-hitchannel;	# will see Ouch when button pressed
.EE
.PP
.B Pointer
and
.B keyboard
pass mouse and keyboard events to a
.BR Tk
window
for delivery to widgets; they must be called by each application,
which usually receives them via a
.B Wmcontext
structure (see
.IR draw-context (2))
obtained from the window manager, often via
.IR tkclient (2).
.PP
.B Putimage
passes an image and a mask into Tk.
If
.I name
is the name of a Tk widget, it must be either a
.IR panel (9)
widget, or a top level widget (ie,
.RB `` . '')
.BR "" "`"` . "'')"
or a menu widget,
in which case the associated image
or window image is set to
.IR i .
.RI ( m
is ignored for menu and top-level widgets.)
Otherwise,
.I name
must be the name of an existing
.IR image (9)
which has its image and mask
set to copies of
.I i
and
.I m
respectively.
.PP
Initially, a Tk toplevel has no image to draw on.
Tk uses
.B wreq
to request new images of an external authority, and to inform
said authority when the images are to be deleted.
The requests are formatted as per
.B quoted
in
.IR string (2),
and hold one of the following:
.TP
.B !reshape \fIname\fP \fIreqid\fP \fIminx miny maxx maxy\fP
A new image for
.I name
is requested
.RI ( name
is either the toplevel widget or a menu).
The desired rectangle for the new image is given
by
.RI [ "minx miny maxx maxy" ],
and the application should respond by creating a new
image and using
.B putimage
to pass it to Tk.
.I Reqid
is used by Tk to filter out responses to out-of-date
requests; when responding to a reshape
request, the
.I name
passed to
.B putimage
should have a space and
.I reqid
appended.
.IR Tkclient (2)
usually deals with the details of this.
.TP
.B delete \fIname\fP
The image
.I name
has been deleted. This is generated for
.IR menu (9)
widgets when they are unmapped.
.TP
.B raise \fIname\fP
Tk widget
.I name
should be raised above other windows on the same screen.
.TP
.B lower \fIname\fP
Tk widget
.I name
should be lowered beneath other windows on the same screen.
.PP
.B Wreq
may be set to nil if an application is not prepared to
read requests sent on this channel.
.PP
.B Rect
returns the bounding rectangle of
widget
.I name
in
.IR top .
.I Flags
determines the form of rectangle returned.
If
.I flags
is zero, the actual rectangle of
.I name
in screen coordinates, not including its border,
is returned. The bitmask flags that can change this are:
.TP
.B Border
Include the widget's border.
.TP
.B Required
Return the rectangle required by the widget, rather
than the rectangle that has been actually allocated to it.
.TP
.B Local
Return the rectangle in coordinates relative
to the logical origin of the actual top level image.
.PP
.B Quote
returns a string that is the same as its arguments, but enclosed
in curly braces and with internal curly braces escaped.
This can be used to make an arbitrary string into a
.I word
suitable as an argument to a Tk function.
.PP
.B Color
returns a colour in 32-bit RGBA format corresponding to the
tk colour name
.IR s .
(see
.IR types (9)
for details).
.PP
.B Screenr
gives the rectangle of the screen containing the toplevel window.
Tk has no
.I "a priori"
way of knowing what this is; it is initially set to the rectangle of the
display image, and may be set by the application if it knows better
(e.g. from the
.B wmrect
file served by
.IR wm (1)).
