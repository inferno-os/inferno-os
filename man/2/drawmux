.SH NAME
drawmux \- multiplex stream of draw requests
.SH SYNOPSIS

include "drawmux.m";
drawmux := load Drawmux Drawmux->PATH;

init:	    fn(): (string, ref Draw->Display);
newviewer:  fn(fd: ref Sys->FD);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Drawmux
puts itself between the invoking application and
.B /dev/draw
(see
.IR draw (3)),
so that the contents of the current display can be replicated elsewhere.
.PP
.B Init
returns a new
.B Display
(see
.IR draw-display (2))
representing a connection to a virtual display device.
Subsequent
.B Draw
requests to that display
(see
.IR draw-intro (2))
are forwarded to the underlying
.IR draw (3)
device to appear on the physical display, but can also replicated
elsewhere, typically in a window on a remote display.
.PP
.B Newviewer
prepares the virtual display end of a
.B Drawmux
connection for each new viewer of the display created by a previous call to
.BR init .
The file descriptor
.I fd
is a connection to the viewer.
The remote viewer must first write 24 bytes on that connection,
containing two decimal numbers (each 11 digits and a space),
giving the identifier of a public screen on the viewer's display, on which
.B newviewer
will replicate the
.B Drawmux
display,
and the log (base 2) of the number of bits per pixel for windows created on that screen.
The remote viewer must then use
.B Sys->export
(see
.IR sys-dial (2))
to export its
.BR /dev/draw ,
which
.B newviewer
expects to find as the root of the exported hierarchy.
Subsequent draw operations on the
.B Drawmux
display will be replicated on the public screen exported by the viewer.
Shutting down the connection shuts down the multiplexor for that viewer.
