.SH DESCRIPTION
A
.B Screen
is the data structure representing a set of windows visible on a particular
.B Image
such as the display or a parent window.
.TP 10
.B id
When a
.B Screen
object is allocated (see
.B allocate
below), the system assigns it a unique integer,
.BR id .
It may be declared ``public'' and accessible to
arbitrary processes and machines with access to the screen's
.BR Display .
The
.B id
value may be used as an argument to
.BR Display.publicscreen ;
see
.IR draw-display (2).
.TP
.B fill
When windows are deleted from a screen, the system uses the
.B fill
image to repaint the screen's base image.
.TP
.B image
The image upon which the windows appear.
.TP
.B display
The display upon which the screen resides.
.TP
.BI allocate( image\fP,\fP\ fill\fP,\fP\ public )
.B Allocate
makes a new
.B Screen
object.
The
.I image
argument provides the base image on which the windows will be made.
The
.I fill
argument provides the
.B Screen.fill
image.
.B Allocate
does not affect the contents of
.IR image ;
it may be necessary after allocation to paint the base image with
.BR fill .
.IP
Using a non-zero
.I public
argument allocates a public screen; zero requests a private screen.
Public screens may be attached by any process
on any machine with access to the
.B Display
upon which the screen is allocated, enabling remote processes to
create windows on the screen.
Knowing only the
.B id
field of the original
.BR Screen ,
the remote process can call the
.B Display.publicscreen
function to acquire a handle to the screen.
The
.B image
and
.B fill
fields of a
.B Screen
obtained this way are
.BR nil ,
but they are not needed for ordinary window management.
.TP
.IB screen .newwindow( r\fP,\fP\ backing\fP,\fP\ rgba )
Allocates a window
on the display at the specified rectangle with the background
colour
.IR rgba ,
expressed in 32-bit RGBA format; the return value is an
.B Image
that may be used like any other.
The
.I backing
parameter can be
.BR Draw->Refbackup ,
which provides backing store to store obscured parts of the window when necessary,
and is used by the window manager and its clients; or
.BR Draw->Refnone ,
wihch provides no refresh, and is used for windows that are transient, or are already protected by backing
store.
.TP
.IB screen .top( wins )
.B Top
organizes a group of windows on a screen.
Given
.IR wins ,
an array of window images, it places the
.I wins[0]
element at the top,
.I wins[1]
behind that, and so on,
with the last element of
.I wins
in front of the all the windows on the screen not in
.IR wins .
Images in the array must be on the specified
.I screen
.RB ( nil
elements are ignored).
