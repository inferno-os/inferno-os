.SH DESCRIPTION
The IP device serves a directory representing a self-contained
collection of IP interfaces.
There may be several instances, identified by the decimal interface number
.IR ifn ,
that follows the
.B #I
device name;
.B #I0
is assumed by default.
Each instance
has a disjoint collection of IP interfaces, routes and address resolution maps.
A physical or virtual device, or
.IR medium ,
that produces IP packets is associated
with a logical IP network using the mechanisms described under
.I "Physical and logical interfaces"
below.
Commonly all IP media on a host are assigned to a single
instance of
.BR #I ,
which is conventionally bound to
.BR /net ,
but other configurations are possible: interfaces might be assigned
to different device instances forming separate
logical IP networks
to partition networks in firewall or
gateway applications.
.PP
Hosted Inferno provides a subset of the interface described here that gives
to  the TCP/IP and UDP/IP of the host system's own IP subsystem.
See
.IR "Hosted interfaces"
below for a summary of the differences.
.SS Protocols
Within each instance,
the IP device provides
an interface to each IP protocol configured into the system, such as TCP/IP or UDP/IP.
.PP
Each of the protocols is served by the IP device, which represents a
connection by a set of device files.
The top level directory,
.I proto
in the
.SM SYNOPSIS
above,
is named after a protocol (eg,
.BR tcp ,
.BR il ,
.BR udp )
and contains a
.B clone
file, a
.B stats
file,
and subdirectories numbered from zero to the number of connections
configured for this protocol.
.PP
The read-only
.B stats
file contains protocol-specific statistics as one or more lines of text.
There is no particular format, but the values are often a superset
of those required by the SNMP MIB.
.PP
Opening the
.B clone
file reserves a connection, represented by
one of the numbered subdirectories.  The resulting file descriptor
will be open on the control file,
.BR ctl ,
of the newly allocated connection.
Reading the
.B ctl
file returns a text
string representing the number of the
connection.
Connections may be used either to listen for incoming calls
or to initiate calls to other machines.
.PP
A connection is controlled by writing text strings to the associated
.B ctl
file.
After a connection has been established data may be read from
and written to the data file.
.PP
Before sending data, remote and local addresses must be set for the connection.
For outgoing calls the local port number will be allocated randomly if none is set.
Addresses are set by writing control messages to the
.B ctl
file of the connection.
The connection is not established until the data file is opened.
There are two models depending on the nature of the protocol.
For connection-oriented protocols, the process will block on open
until the remote host has acknowledged the connection,
either accepting it, causing a successful return from open,
or rejecting it, causing open to return an appropriate error.
For connectionless protocols, the open always succeeds;
the `connect' request sets local parameters for the source and destination fields
for use by subsequent read and write requests.
.PP
The following control messages are provided by this interface
to all protocols.
A particular protocol can provide additional commands, or
change the interpretation or even syntax of those below,
as described in the manual page for that protocol.
The description below shows
the standard commands with the default argument syntax and interpretation:
.TP
.BI connect\  ipaddress ! port "[!r]\ [\f2lport\f5]"
Set the remote IP address and port number for the connection.
If the
.B r
flag
is supplied and the optional local port
.I lport
has not been specified the system will allocate
a restricted port number (between 600 and 1024) for the connection to allow communication
with Unix machines'
.B login
and
.B exec
services.
.TP
.BI "announce\ [" ipaddress !] port
Set the local port
number to
.I port
and accept calls to that port.
.I Port
is a decimal port number or
.LR * .
If
.I port
is zero, assign a port number
(the one assigned can be read from the
.B local
address file).
If
.I port
is
.LR * ,
accept
calls for any port that no process has explicitly announced.
If the optional
.I ipaddress
is given, set the local IP address for the connection
to that address, and accept only those incoming calls to
.I port
that are addressed to
.IR ipaddress .
.B Announce
fails if the connection is already announced or connected.
.TP
.BI bind\  port
.I Port
is a decimal port number or
.LR * .
Set the local port number to
.IR port .
This request exists to support emulation of
of BSD sockets and is otherwise neither needed nor used in Inferno.
.TP
.BI tos " \f1[\f2 n \f1]\f2"
Set the type-of-service value in outgooing packets to
.I n
(default: 0).
.TP
.BI ttl " \f1[\f2 n \f1]\f2"
Set the time-to-live (TTL) value in packets transmitted on this conversation
to
.I n
(default: 255).
.PP
Port numbers must be in the range 1 to 32767.
.PP
Several read-only files report the status of a
connection.
The
.B remote
and
.B local
files contain the IP address and port number for the remote and local side of the
connection.
The
.B status
file contains protocol-dependent information to help debug network connections.
The first word on the first line gives the status of the
connection.
.PP
Having announced, a process may accept incoming connections by calling
.B open
on the
.B listen
file.
The
.B open
will block until a new connection request arrives;
it will then
return an open file descriptor that points to the control file of the
newly accepted connection.
Repeating this procedure will accept all calls for the
given protocol.
.PP
In general it should not be necessary to use the file system interface to the
networks.
The
.BR dial ,
.BR announce ,
and
.BR listen
functions described in
.IR sys-dial (2)
perform the necessary I/O to establish and
manipulate network connections.
.SS TCP protocol
The TCP protocol is the standard Internet
protocol for reliable stream communication; it does not preserve
read/write
boundaries.
.PP
A connection is controlled by writing text strings to the associated
.B ctl
file.
After a connection has been established data may be read from
and written to the data file.
The TCP protocol provides a stream connection that does not preserve
read/write
boundaries.
.PP
For outgoing calls the local port number will be allocated randomly if none is set.
Addresses are set by writing control messages to the
.B ctl
file of the connection.
The connection is not established until the data file is opened.
For TCP the
process will block until the remote host has acknowledged the connection.
.PP
As well as the standard control messages above,
TCP accepts the following:
.TP
.BI hangup
Send a TCP reset (RST) to the remote side and end the conversation,
without waiting for untransmitted data to be acknowledged,
unlike a normal close of the device.
.TP
.BI keepalive\ [ "n" ]
Enable `keep alive'
mode:
if no traffic crosses the link within a given period, send a
packet to check that the remote party is still there, and remind
it that the local connection is still live.
The optional value
.I n
gives the keep-alive time in milliseconds (default: 120000).
.PP
The
.B status
file has many lines, each containing a labelled number, giving the values
of parameters and statistics such as:
maximum allowed connections, outgoing calls, incoming calls, established but later reset,
active calls, input segments, output segments, retransmitted segments, retransmitted timeouts,
input errors, transmitted reset.
.SS UDP protocol
.PP
UDP provides the standard Internet
protocol for unreliable datagram
communication.
.PP
UDP opens always succeed.
Before sending data, remote and local addresses must be set for the connection.
Alternatively, the following special control requests can be used:
.TP
.B headers
Set the connection to use an address header with IPv6 addressing
on reads and writes of the data file,
allowing a single connection to send datagrams to converse with
many different destination addresses and ports.
The 52 byte binary header appears before the data
read or written.
It contains: remote IP address, local IP address, interface IP address, remote port, and local port.
The IP addresses are 16 bytes each in IPv6 format, and
the port addresses are 2 bytes each, all written in network (big-endian) order.
On reads, the header gives the values from the incoming datagram,
except that if the remote used a multicast destination address, the IP address
of the receiving interface is substituted.
On writes, the header provides the destination for the resulting datagram,
and if the local IP address corresponds to a valid local unicast interface,
that address is used, otherwise the IP address of the transmitting interface
is substituted.
.TP
.B oldheaders
Set the connection to use an address header with IPv6 addressing
on reads and writes of the data file,
allowing a single connection to send datagrams to converse with
many different destination addresses and ports.
The 36 byte binary header appears before the data
read or written.
It contains: remote IP address, local IP address, remote port, and local port.
The IP addresses are 16 bytes each in IPv6 format,
the port addresses are 2 bytes each, all written in network (big-endian) order.
On reads, the header gives the values from the incoming datagram,
except that if the remote used a multicast destination address, the IP address
of the receiving interface is substituted.
On writes, the header provides the destination for the resulting datagram,
and if the local IP address corresponds to a valid local unicast interface,
that address is used, otherwise the IP address of the transmitting interface
is substituted.
.TP
.B headers4
Set the connection to use an address header with IPv4 addresses
on reads and writes of the data file,
allowing a single connection to send datagrams to converse with
many different destination addresses and ports.
The 12 byte binary header appears before the data
read or written.
It contains: remote IP address, local IP address, remote port, and local port.
The IP addresses are 4 bytes each,
the port addresses are 2 bytes each, all written in network (big-endian) order.
On reads, the header gives the values from the incoming datagram.
On writes, the header provides the destination for the resulting datagram.
This mode is obsolete and destined for oblivion.
.PP
A read of less than
the size of the datagram will cause the entire datagram to be consumed.
Each write to the data file will send a single datagram on the network.
.PP
In replies, in connection-oriented mode, if the remote address
has not been set, the first arriving packet sets the following
based on the source of the incoming datagram:
the remote address and port for the conversation,
and the local address is set to the destination address in the
datagram unless that is a multicast address, and then the address
of the receiving interface is used.
.PP
If a conversation is in
.B headers
mode, only the local port is relevant.
.PP
Connection-oriented UDP is hungup if an ICMP error (eg, host or port unreachable,
or time exceeded) arrives with matching port.
.PP
The
.I udp
.B status
file contains four lines, each containing a labelled number counting an event:
input datagrams, datagrams on unannounced ports, datagrams with wrong checksum, and output datagrams.
.SS IL Protocol
IL provides a reliable point-to-point datagram service for communication between Plan 9 and
native Inferno machines.
Each read and write transfers a single datagram, as for UDP.
The datagrams are delivered reliably and in order.
Conversations are addressed and established as for TCP.
.SS Routing
.PP
The
.B iproute
file can be read and written.
When read, it returns the contents of the IP routing tables,
one line per entry,
with six fields giving the
destination host or network address, address mask,
gateway address, route type, tag (see below), and the number of the
.B ipifc
interface owning the route
(or
.RB ` - '
if none).
The route type is up to four characters:
.B 4
or
.B 6
(IPv4 or IPv6 route);
.B i
(route is interface);
one of
.B u
(unicast),
.B b
(broadcast),
or
.B m
(multicast);
and lastly
.B p
if the route is point-to-point.
.PP
Commands can also be written to control the routing:
.TP
.BI add " ip mask gw \f1[\f2 tag \f1]\f2"
Add a route via the gateway identified by IP address
.I gw
to the address specified by
.I ip
and subnet mask
.IR mask .
Tag the resulting table entry with the
.I tag
provided, or the current
.I tag
(see
.B tag
below),
or the tag
.BR none .
.TP
.BI flush " \f1[\f2 tag \f1]\f2"
Remove all routes with the given
.I tag
that do not correspond to a local interface.
If
.I tag
is not given, flush all routes.
.TP
.BI remove " ip mask"
Remove routes to the given address.
.TP
.BI tag " tag"
Tag the routes generated by writes on the current file descriptor with
the given
.IR tag
of up to 4 characters.
The default is
.BR none ,
set when
.B iproute
is opened.
.PP
The
.B ipselftab
file summarises the addresses and routes that refer to the local host.
It gives an address, the number of logical interfaces, and the interface type
in the same form as the route type of
.BR iproute .
.PP
The
.B iprouter
file is provided for use by a user-level application acting as an IP gateway.
It is effective only when the kernel-level gateway is not enabled
(see the
.B iprouting
interface control request below).
Once opened, packets that are not addressed to a
local address can be read from this device.
The packet contents are preceded by a 16 byte binary header that
gives the IPv6 address of the local interface that received the packet.
.SS Bootstrap
.PP
The read-only
.B bootp
file contains the results of the last BOOTP
request transmitted on any interface (see
.I "Physical and logical interfaces"
below)
as several lines of text,
with two fields each.
The first field names an entity and the second field gives its value in IPv4 address format.
The current entities are:
.IP
.RS
.TF ipaddr
.TP
.B auip
Authentication server address
.TP
.B fsip
File server address
.TP
.B gwip
Address of an IP gateway out of this (sub)net.
.TP
.B ipaddr
Local IP address
.TP
.B ipmask
Subnet mask for the local IP address
.RE
.PD
.PP
If any value is unknown (no reply to BOOTP, or value unspecified),
the value will be zero, represented as
.BR 0.0.0.0 .
.SS Address resolution
The
.B arp
file can be read and written.
When read,
it returns the contents of the current ARP cache as a sequence of lines,
one per map entry, giving
type, state, IP address and corresponding MAC address.
Several textual commands can be written to it:
.TP
.BI add " \f1[\f2 medium \f1]\f2 ip mac"
Add a mapping from IP address
.I ip
to the given
.I mac
address (a sequence of bytes in hexadecimal)
on the given
.IR medium .
It must support address resolution (eg, Ethernet).
If the
.I medium
is not specified, find the one associated with a route to
.I ip
(which must be IPv4).
.TP
.B flush
Clear the cache.
.SS Logging
.PP
The
.B log
file provides protocol tracing and debugging data.
While the file is held open, the system
saves, in a small circular buffer, error messages logged by selected protocols.
When read, it returns data not previously read,
blocking until there is data to read.
The following commands can be written to determine what is logged:
.TP
.BI set " proto ..."
Enable logging of messages from each source
.IR proto ,
one or more of:
.BR ppp ,
.BR ip ,
.BR fs ,
.BR tcp ,
.BR il ,
.BR icmp ,
.BR udp ,
.BR compress ,
.BR ilmsg ,
.BR gre ,
.BR tcpmsg ,
.BR udpmsg ,
.BR ipmsg
and
.BR esp .
.TP
.BI clear " proto ..."
Disable logging of messages from the given sources.
.SS Physical and logical interfaces
The configuration of the physical and logical IP interfaces
in a given instance of
.B #I
uses
a virtual protocol
.B ipifc
within that instance,
that adds, controls and removes
IP interfaces.
It is represented by the protocol directory
.BR ipifc .
Each connection corresponds to an interface to a physical or virtual medium on
which IP packets can be sent and received.
It has a set of associated values:
minimum and maximum transfer unit,
MAC address, and a set of logical IP interfaces.
Each logical IP interface has local and remote addresses and an address mask.
.PP
Opening the
.B clone
file returns a file descriptor open on the
.B ctl
file for a new connection.
A medium is then attached using a
.B bind
request;
logical interfaces are associated by
.B connect
or
.BR add ;
they are removed by
.BR remove ;
and finally
.B unbind
detaches the medium from the connection.
For certain types of media, the
.B unbind
is automatic when the connection itself is closed.
With most media, including Ethernet,
the
.B ipifc
connection files can be closed after configuration, and later
reopened if need be to add or remove logical interfaces,
or set other parameters.
.PP
The
.B ctl
file responds to the following text commands, including interface-specific variants
of standard
IP device
requests:
.TP
.BI bind " medium " "[ \f5\f2name\f5 [ \f2arg ...\f5 ]"
Attach device
.I medium
to the interface, which must not already be bound to a device.
The
.I name
and subsequent arguments are interpreted by the driver for the
.IR medium .
The device name associated with the interface is
.IR name ,
if given, or a generated name otherwise.
.TP
.BR connect " \f2ip\f5 [\f2mask \f5[\f2remote \f5[\f2mtu \f5]]]"
Remove all existing logical interfaces and create a new one as if by
.B add
(see below).
The connection must be bound to a medium.
.TP
.BR add " \f2ip\f5 [\f2 mask \f5[\f2 remote \f5[\f2 mtu \f5] ] ]"
Add a logical interface with local IP address
.IR ip .
The default for
.I mask
is the mask for
.IR ip 's
address class;
for the
.IR remote
address,
.IR ip 's
network; and for
.IR mtu ,
the largest MTU allowed by the medium.
The new interface is registered in the IP routing tables.
.TP
.B bootp
Broadcast a BOOTP packet (using
.BR udp ).
If a valid response is received, set the interface's IP address and mask,
and the IP stack's default gateway to the results obtained from BOOTP.
The results are also available to applications by reading
the
.B bootp
file above.
Note that this mechanism is now deprecated in favour of
.IR dhcpclient (2).
.TP
.BI remove " ip mask"
Remove the logical interface determined by
.I ip
and
.IR mask .
.TP
.BI iprouting\ [ "n" ]
Control the use of IP routing on this
.IR ip (3)
instance.
If
.I n
is missing or non-zero, allow use as a gateway,
rerouting via one interface packets received on another.
By default,
or if
.I n
is zero, use as a gateway is not allowed: if a packet received
is not addressed to any local interface, either pass it to
a gateway application if active (see
.B iprouter
in
.IR ip (3)),
and otherwise drop the packet.
.TP
.BI mtu " n"
.br
Set the maximum transmit unit (MTU) on this interface to
.I n
bytes, which must be valid for the medium.
.TP
.BI addmulti " multi"
Add the multicast address
.I multi
to the interface.
.TP
.BI remmulti " multi"
Remove the multicast address
.I multi
from the interface.
.TP
.BI unbind
Remove any association between
the current medium (device) and the connection:
remove all routes using this interface, detach the device,
stop packet transport, and
remove all logical interfaces.
The connection is ready for re-use.
.PP
The
.B local
file contains one line for each logical interface, of the form:
.IP
.IB local -> self ...
.PP
where
.I local
is the local address associated with the interface and each
.I self
is a broadcast or multicast address that can address that interface,
including subnet addresses, if any.
.PP
The
.B status
file contains many fields:
the first two give the device name and the value of the current MTU,
followed by 7 fields per line for each logical interface:
local address, address mask, remote address, packets in, packets out, input errors, and output errors.
.PP
The following sections describe the media drivers available.
Each is separately configurable into a kernel.
.SS Ethernet medium
Ethernet devices as described in
.IR ether (3)
can be bound to an IP interface.
The bind request has the form:
.IP
.BI "bind ether " device
.PP
The interface opens two conversations on the given Ethernet
.IR device ,
for instance
.BR ether0 ,
using an internal version of
.BR dial ,
with the addresses
.IB device !0x800
(IPv4)
and
.IB device !0x806
(ARP).
See
.IR sys-dial (2)
for the interpretation of such addresses.
The interface runs until a process does an explicit
.BR unbind .
Multicast settings made on the interface are propagated to the
.IR device .
.SS Point-to-point medium
An asynchronous serial device as described in
.IR eia (3)
can be bound to an interface as a Point-to-Point protocol (PPP) device.
The bind request has the form:
.IP
.BI "bind ppp " "serial ip remote mtu framing username secret"
.PP
All parameters except
.I serial
are optional.
The character
.RB ` - '
can appear as a placeholder for any parameter.
Except for authentication data, an attempt is made to negotiate
suitable values for any missing parameter values, including network addresses.
The parameters are interpreted as follows:
.IP
.RS
.TF username
.TP
.I serial
Name of the device that will run PPP.
.TP
.I ip
Local IP address for the interface.
.TP
.I remote
IP address of the other end of the link.
.TP
.I mtu
Initial MTU value for negotiation (default: 1450)
.TP
.I framing
If
.I framing
is zero, do not provide asynch. framing (on by default).
Unimplemented.
.TP
.I username
Identification string used in PAP or CHAP authentication.
.TP
.I secret
Secret used in authentication; with CHAP it never crosses the link.
.PD
.RE
.PP
If the name
.I serial
contains
.RB ` ! '
a connection will be opened using
.B dial
(see
.IR sys-dial (2)).
Otherwise the name will be opened as-is;
usually it is the name of a serial device
(eg,
.BR "#t/eia0" ).
In the latter case, a companion
.B ctl
file will also be opened if possible, to set serial characteristics for PPP
(flow control, 64kbyte queue size, nonblocking writes).
An attempt is made to start the PPP link immediately.
The write of the
.B bind
control message returns with an error if the link cannot be started,
or if negotiation fails.
The PPP link is automatically unbound if the line hangs up (eg, modem drops carrier),
or an unrecoverable error occurs when reading or writing the connection.
.PP
The PPP implementation can use either PAP and CHAP authentication,
as negotiated, provided an appropriate
.I username
and
.I secret
is given in the
.B bind
request.
It does not yet support the Microsoft authentication scheme.
.SS Packet medium
The packet medium allows an application to be source and sink
for IP packets.
It is bound to an interface by the simple request:
.IP
.B "bind pkt"
.PP
All other interface parameters including its IP address are
set using the standard
.I ipifc
requests described above.
Once that has been done, the application reads the
.B data
file of the interface to receive packets addressed to the interface,
and it writes to the file to inject packets into the IP network.
The interface is automatically unbound when all interface files are closed.
.SS Hosted interfaces
Native Inferno and Plan 9 have related IP implementations.
Plan 9
.I emu
therefore simply imports Plan 9's
.BR /net ,
and in the absence of version-specific differences, what is described
above still applies.
.PP
On all other hosted platforms,
the IP device gives applications
within
.IR emu (1)
a portable interface to TCP/IP and UDP/IP, even through it
is ultimately using the host system's own TCP/IP and UDP/IP implementations
(usually but not always socket based).
The interface remains the same: for instance by
.B /net/tcp
and
.BR /net/udp ,
but is currently more limited in the set of services and control requests.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 address syntax may be used, but the IPv6 form must
still map to the IPv4 address space.
Only TCP and UDP are generally available, and a limited interface to ARP on some platforms (see below).
The set of TCP/UDP control requests is limited to:
.BR connect ,
.BR announce ,
.BR bind ,
.BR ttl ,
.BR tos ,
.BR ignoreadvice ,
.BR headers4 ,
.BR oldheaders ,
.BR headers ,
.BR hangup
and
.BR keepalive .
.PP
The write-only
.B arp
file is implemented only on some Unix systems, and
is intended to allow the implementation of
the BOOTP protocol
using Inferno, on hosted systems.
It accepts a single textual control request:
.TP
.BI add " ip ether"
Add a new ARP map entry, or replace an existing one, for IP address
.IR ip ,
associating it with the given
.I ether
MAC address.
The
.I ip
address is expressed in the usual dotted address notation;
.I ether
is a 12 digit hexadecimal number.
.PP
An error results if the host system does not allow the ARP map
to be set, or the current user lacks the privileges to set it.
